# Active Directory Homelab

A Windows enterprise homelab built with Hyper-V, Windows Server 2025, Windows 11 Enterprise, Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, file services, and PowerShell.

The goal of this project is to build hands-on experience with Windows administration, networking, identity management, automation, and troubleshooting.

## Lab Overview

| System | Role |
|---|---|
| DC01 | Active Directory Domain Services, DNS |
| SRV01 | DHCP, File Services |
| CLIENT01 | Windows 11 domain workstation |
| Windows 11 Host | Hyper-V and NAT |

**Domain:** `corp.adlab.test`  
**Lab Network:** `10.10.10.0/24`

For the full network and Active Directory design, see [Architecture](./docs/architecture.md).

## Features

- Active Directory Domain Services
- Active Directory-integrated DNS
- DHCP
- Organizational Unit (OU)
- Domain users and groups
- Windows domain joins
- Group Policy
- File and NTFS permissions
- PowerShell automation
- Hyper-V networking and NAT
- Troubleshooting documentation

## PowerShell Automation

PowerShell scripts are used to automate common administration tasks.

User provisioning is performed from fictional CSV data stored in:

```text
data/users.csv
```

Planned improvements include duplicate checks, logging, validation, group assignment, and error handling.

## Troubleshooting

Problems encountered during the build are documented using:
